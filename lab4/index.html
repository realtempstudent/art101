			<h1>Subject of this Lab</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The subject of this lab is to develop pseudocode for an everyday task and for a simple computer game, for the purpose of understanding pseudocode's purpose and creation.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Difficulties Encountered</h2>
					<p>The only difficulties encountered were trying to decide upon which steps should be described and how they should be described, but aside from that no difficulties worth noting were reported.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>This is the pseudocode for replacing a SIM card from a smartphone, placed in a &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; code block.</p>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<pre><code>
Remove any protective cases your phone may have, if any.
Obtain a specialized tool for SIM card removal; a small paper clip will suffice as well, but if this option is chosen, the person doing the removal needs to unbend the paper clip and straighten the point long enough to fit into the hole.
Place the tip of the paper clip or tool into the hole and press with not too much force, but just enough to apply some amount of pressure.
If done correctly, the SIM card slot will dislodge out of its slot, enabling access to the SIM card.
Replace the SIM card with the new one of your choice.
When replacement is complete, slide the slot back into place and the latch will engage again, rendering the SIM card operational for use.
						</pre></code>
					</div>
					<p>This is the pseudocode for RPS (rock paper scissors), placed in a &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt; code block.</p>
					<div class="minor-section">
						<pre><code>
Ask the user for input confirming their selection
When a valid input is received, the computer randomly chooses one of the three options of RPS
The computer displays which outputs have been chosen by both participants and then declares the result of the game based on what inputs have been provided.
	If both inputs are the same, the game declares a tie.
	Else, the computer displays which person has won based on whose input beats the other’s input.
After completion of the above steps, the game asks the user if they wish to play once more.
						</pre></code>
					</div>
					<p>This is the pseudocode for RPS (rock paper scissors), commented as if it were in a JavaScript file.</p>
					<div class="minor-section">
