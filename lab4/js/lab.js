// Pseudocode for RPS (Rock Paper Scissors)
// Ask the user for input confirming their selection
// When a valid input is received, the computer randomly chooses one of the three options of RPS
// The computer displays which outputs have been chosen by both participants and then declares the result of the game based on what inputs have been provided.
  // If both inputs are the same, the game declares a tie.
  // Else, the computer displays which person has won based on whose input beats the otherâ€™s input.
// After completion of the above steps, the game asks the user if they wish to play once more.
