					<p>What was wrong was that my code's "my-input" and "my-button" were in fact the incorrect id labels to use for identification.</p>
					<p>My JavaScript searched for "input" and "button" specifically, and since they could only find "my-input" and "my-button" instead of "input" and "button", a syntax error was the result.</p>
					<p>Once this problem was identified, changing the id labels let the code work correctly.</p>
